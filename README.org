** Enhanced throw and catch for Clojure

   Provides try+ and throw+. Each is 100% compatible with Clojure and
   Java's native try and throw both in source code and at runtime. Each
   also provides new capabilities intended to improve ease of use by
   leveraging Clojure's capabilities like records and destructuring.

   Clojure's native try and throw behave much like those of Java: throw
   can accept objects derived from java.lang.Throwable and try selects
   from among catch clauses based on the class of the thrown object.

   In addition to fully supporting those uses (whether they originate
   from Clojure code or from Java code via interop), try+ and throw+
   provide these enhanced capabilities:

  - throw+ can throw any Java object, not just those whose class is
    derived from java.lang.Throwable.

    Clojure maps or records become an easy way to represent custom
    exceptions without requiring gen-class.

  - catch clauses within try+ can catch any Java object thrown by
    throw+, Clojure's throw, or Java's throw. The first catch clause
    whose selector matches the thrown object will execute.

    a selector can be:

    - a class name (e.g., Integer, my.clojure.record, RuntimeException),
      matches any instance of that class, or

    - a predicate (function of one argument like map?, a keyword, or a
      symbol), matches any Object for which the predicate returns a
      truthy value, or

    - a selector form (a list beginning with a keyword):

      - a (:key key [value]) selector
        - with no value, matches if the thrown object contains? key
        - with a value, matches if get returns value when passed key

      - a (:type parent [hierarchy]) selector
        - with no hierarchy, matches if (isa? (type thrown) parent)
        - with a hierarchy, matches if (isa? hierarchy (type thrown)
          parent)

  - the binding to the caught exception in a catch clause is not
    required to be a simple symbol. It is subject to destructuring so
    the body of the catch clause can use the contents of a thrown
    collection easily.

  - in a catch clause, the context at the throw site is accessible via
    the hidden argument &throw-context. The context includes the
    thrown object, the stack trace, the environment (bound locals and
    their values), and a reference the context of the exception that
    caused the current throw. (similar to Exception's .getCause chain)
