(defmacro try+
  "Like the try special form, but with enhanced catch clauses:
    - specify objects to catch by classname, predicate, or
      selector form;
    - destructure the caught object;
    - access the context at the throw site via the &throw-context
      hidden argument.

  A selector form is a form containing one or more instances of % to
  be replaced by the thrown object. If it evaluates to truthy, the
  object is caught.

  The classname and predicate selectors are shorthand for these
  selector forms:

    <classname> => (instance? <classname> %)
    <predicate> => (<predicate> %)

  &throw-context is a map containing:
    - for all caught objects:
      :obj      the thrown object;
      :stack    the stack trace;
    - for Throwable caught objects:
      :msg      the message, from .getMessage;
      :cause    the cause, from .getCause;
    - for non-Throwable caught objects:
      :msg      the message, from the optional argument to throw+;
      :cause    the cause, captured by throw+, see below;
      :wrapper  the outermost Throwable wrapper of the caught object,
                see below;
      :env      a map of bound symbols to their values.

  To throw a non-Throwable object, throw+ wraps it with an object of
  type Stone. That Stone in turn may end up being wrapped by other
  exceptions (e.g., instances of RuntimeException or
  java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException). try+ \"sees through\" all
  such wrappers to find the object wrapped by the first instance of
  Stone in the outermost wrapper's cause chain. If needed, the
  outermost wrapper is available within a catch clause at the :wrapper
  key in &throw-context. Any nested wrappers are accessible via its
  cause chain.

  When throw+ throws a non-Throwable object from within a try+ catch
  clause, the outermost wrapper of the caught object being processed
  is captured as the \"cause\" of the new throw.
